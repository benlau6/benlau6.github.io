# Programming

## Advices

- Being a "good programmer" means being able to write good code when things aren't perfect.
- Programming is more about communicating with the next programmer, which includes your future self then telling the computer what to do.
- Wrong duplication is better than the wrong abstraction.
- A program is never finished, only abandoned. Documentation and ease of readability are essential.
  - A picture is worth a thousand words.

## Exception vs Error vs Assertion

- [Why I Prefer Exceptions To Errors - Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6u5UU3t3c)
- [Assertions detect programmer errors. Unlike operating errors, which are expected and which must be handled, assertion failures are unexpected. The only correct way to handle corrupt code is to crash. Assertions downgrade catastrophic correctness bugs into liveness bugs. Assertions are a force multiplier for discovering bugs by fuzzing.](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER-STYLE.md#safety)
