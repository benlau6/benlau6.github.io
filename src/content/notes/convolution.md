# Convolution

1D convolution is mainly used in signal processing and time series analysis. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs, a signal and a kernel, and produces an output signal. The kernel is a small array of numbers that slides over the input signal, multiplying its values with the kernel values and summing the results. The kernel is also called a filter or a mask.

2D convolution is used in image processing while 3D convolution is used in video processing.
