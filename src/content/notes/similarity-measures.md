# Similarity Measures

Similarity measures or similarity metrics are real-valued functions that quantify the similarity between two objects.

## Formulas

- Cosine similarity only cares about angle difference
- Dot product cares about angle and magnitude, but if the vectors are normalized, it's the same as cosine similarity
