# Unsupervised Learning

## Methods

[clustering](clustering.md)

## How to evaluate

- Does the method perform well in the context of business goal? How well a particular unsupervised method performs will largely depend on why one is doing unsupervised learning in the first place. [stackoverflow](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/79028/performance-metrics-to-evaluate-unsupervised-learning)
- Human evaluation
- Leave some data out, add the data afterwards, is the model robust?
- Try a downstream auxiliary task. The performance of the downstream task can serve as a surrogate for the performance of the unsupervised learner.
