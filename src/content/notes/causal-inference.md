# Causal Inference

- Control the potential confounding variables which could bias the results
- Treatment and control groups
- Assignment mechanism
- Potential outcomes

## AB Testing

[AB Testing note](ab-testing.md)

## Causal Impact (Bayesian Structural Time Series)

- It uses [state-space models](state-space-models.md)
