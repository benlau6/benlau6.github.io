# Linked Lists

- a linked list variable is a reference to the HEAD node of the list
- a node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list
- the last node contains a value and a NULL reference

## Implementations of difference languages

- python / java / javascripts use references to implement linked lists
- while C / C++ use [pointers](/pointers.md) to implement linked lists
