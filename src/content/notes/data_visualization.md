  - D3 is great for explanatory visuals, not exploratory. If I am finished studying a refined hypothesis and want to show a specific result I'd use D3. Or if I want something highly customized because I know exactly how the data will look, D3 is great. But most of what I do is exploratory. I'm not exactly sure what the data will look like.
