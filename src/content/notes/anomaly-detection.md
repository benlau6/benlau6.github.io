# Anomaly Detection

## Use IQR instead of standard deviation

- Robustness to outliers: Outliers badly affect the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. These may statistically give erroneous results. The IQR measures the range between the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles, encompassing the middle 50% of the data. This makes it less sensitive to extreme values or outliers.
- Non-Normal skewed distributions: When data is not normally distributed or skewed distributed, the standard deviation may not accurately reflect the spread of the data. The IQR is a better measure of variability in such cases, as it focuses on the central portion of the data.
