# Modeling

## One-liners

- "All models are wrong, but some are useful." -- George Box
- "A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality … While a model can never be "truth," a model might be ranked from very useful, to useful, to somewhat useful to, finally, essentially useless." -— Ken Burnham and David Anderson
- The best model is the simplest model that explains the data -- Occam's razor
- Avoid Simpson's paradox
- It is a must to be aware of [overfitting](/regularization.md)

## Variable modeling

- [Distribution modeling](/distributions.md#popular-choice-of-modeling)

## Two way fixed effects
