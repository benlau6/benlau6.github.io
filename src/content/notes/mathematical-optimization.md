# Mathematical Optimization

## How to solve

- Greedy algorithms
- Simplex method for linear programming
- Gradient descent for non-linear optimization
- [Branch and bound](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/mcasquilho/compute/_linpro/TaylorB_module_c.pdf) - normally used for integer programming, which partitions the feasible solution space
  into smaller subsets of solutions.
- Genetic algorithms - heuristic search algorithms that solve constrained and unconstrained optimization problems using the concepts of natural selection such as mutation, crossover, and selection.
