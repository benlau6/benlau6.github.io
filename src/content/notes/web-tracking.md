# Web Tracking

- Page visibility: discount the time when the page is not visible. E.g. when the user switches to another tab. [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)
- Time on page: setting a timer when the page is loaded or resumed and stop it when the page is inactive. It is better than calculating the time difference between two consecutive page views because a user might leave the website after consuming the content, e.g. reading a lengthy blog. Page visibility should also be considered because a user might switch to another tab while reading the content, or the user might take a break and leave the page open.
- Scroll depth: Create custom dimensions for scroll percentages such as 10%, 25%, 50%, and so forth. This method effectively tracks how far users scroll through our blog posts, providing insights into their interest and engagement with the entire content.

- Google signals are not user id nor client id. It is a feature that allows GA to track users across devices. It is based on the signed-in user's activity on Google services.
