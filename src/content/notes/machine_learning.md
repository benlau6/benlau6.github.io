## One liners

- precision cares about the cost of false positives, while recall cares about the cost of false negatives
- MAE is more robust to outliers than MSE, but it is not differentiable at 0, which can be a problem for optimization, especially for gradient-based methods. RMSE is a compromise between the two.
