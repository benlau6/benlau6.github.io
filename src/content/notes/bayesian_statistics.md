# Bayesian Statistics

- Bayesian model often refers to generative models.
- [Bayesian inference: are parameters fixed or random?](https://thestatsgeek.com/2015/04/22/bayesian-inference-are-parameters-fixed-or-random/)
  - It is often said (incorrectly) that ‘parameters are treated as fixed by the frequentist but as random by the Bayesian’. For frequentists and Bayesians alike, the value of a parameter may have been fixed from the start or may have been generated from a physically random mechanism. In either case, both suppose it has taken on some fixed value that we would like to know. The Bayesian uses formal probability models to express personal uncertainty about that value. The ‘randomness’ in these models represents personal uncertainty about the parameter’s value; it is not a property of the parameter (although we should hope it accurately reflects properties of the mechanisms that produced the parameter).
  - while there may be certain situations where it might be reasonable to think of parameters as being generated through some stochastic mechanism, otherwise, the treatment of the parameter as a random quantity is a device to represent our uncertainty about its fixed true value.
