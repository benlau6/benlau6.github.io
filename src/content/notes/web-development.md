# Web Development

## Python

FastAPI is a modern Flask, i.e. a API framework. While Django is a full stack web framework that is batteries included for building website. [ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1dxcdiy/flask_django_or_fastapi/)

## HTMX

HTMX is a great tool for building frontend when these is not much interactivity needed because it is just a representation of the state from backend, which remove code duplication and mental effort to rebuild state management for frontend, which also avoid the need to sync it with backend state management. A typical use case would be a CRUD internal tool. A typical bad use case would be dashboard. [htmx notes](/htmx.md)
