# Bootstrapping

- Replicating the experiment is time-consuming and expensive.
- Instead of replicating the experiment, bootstrapping uses the sample data to approximate the population distribution by sampling with replacement.
- It is a great and convenient tool to estimate the reliability of a estimated statistic when the underlying distribution is unknown.
