# Signal Processing

When there are noises in the time domain seasonality, it is very difficult to isolate them. By changing the signal from time domain to the frequency domain, we can see the frequency of the signal, isolate the noises, and get the seasonality components.

## Frequency resolution and zero-padding

## Fast Fourier Transform

## Wavelets

Wavelets are a set of fucntions. It provides temporal specificity because its kernel would decay at both ends. It could have a Gaussian spectral shape, i.e. it has Gaussian shape in frequency domain.
